## Overview

<a href="#">Koyfin for macOS</a> is built for investors who move fluidly between equities, ETFs, macro indicators and cross-asset relationships. It consolidates watchlists, charts, fundamentals, earnings and economic data into one adaptable dashboard. Instead of hopping between multiple browser tabs and data terminals, users can configure a single workspace that mirrors how they think about markets. This helps maintain a coherent view of portfolios and themes even when attention shifts quickly between sectors and regions.

The platform’s charting and table views are designed to work together. A symbol clicked in a watchlist can drive linked charts, financials, peers and news, reducing friction when digging into a new idea. Relative performance, correlation and factor overlays encourage a structured approach to comparing opportunities. With <a href="#">screeners and custom layouts</a>, users can spin up dedicated views for income portfolios, growth themes or macro hedges, then save them for later review.

On macOS, Koyfin adopts clean visuals that sit comfortably next to brokers, research PDFs and productivity tools. Multi-monitor traders can dedicate an entire display to Koyfin or dock it beside note-taking apps for research sessions. Over time, it becomes a default starting point for answering questions like “what changed today?”, “how is this sector behaving?” or “where does this company sit within its peer group?”.
